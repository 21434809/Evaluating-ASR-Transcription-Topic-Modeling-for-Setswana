# Evaluating ASR Transcription and Topic Modeling for Setswana

## Project Overview
This project evaluates the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems and applies topic modeling techniques to Setswana transcriptions. The goal is to analyze the quality of ASR transcriptions and explore how well topic modeling can extract meaningful topics from Setswana text data.

## Features
- ASR transcription evaluation for Setswana language.
- Topic modeling using techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic .
- Data preprocessing and cleaning for Setswana text.
- Performance metrics and analysis.

## Requirements
Below is a list of packages required to run the project:

### Python Packages
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `gensim`
- `nltk`
- `torch` (if using PyTorch-based models)
- `transformers` (for advanced NLP tasks)

### Additional Tools
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive exploration)
